##MHN Server Setup

-Before deploying this django server, ensure that the MHN server is up and running. Follow the install guide
at the [MHN Repo](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn) for specific instructions. Ubuntu 14.04 is required for the
server software, although the honeypots can run on any version of Ubuntu. The honeypot deploy script available on the
MHN management server will automatically register the sensors with the management server.

-Once the server is up, make note of the API key and UUID of the various sensors
